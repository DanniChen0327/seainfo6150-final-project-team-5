Measure 4 inches down from the top of the strands and insert a toothpick through all 4 pieces to attach them at the top. Separate the strands below the toothpick so they are no longer stacked on top of each other. Interlace the far-right strand first under the strand next to it, then over the strand next to that and finally under the last strand (on the left) to create the first weave, tightening as you go to create a snug pattern. Continue the pattern by bringing the same strand back over the strand closest to it, then under the next strand and finally over the last strand on the far right.",
      "Repeat this pattern--weaving side to side and back again--until the strand has been completely woven through. Using a toothpick, attach another 3-foot strand where the original one left off and continue until the new strand is woven through. Cut the remaining unwoven strands at the bottom. Use toothpicks to secure the scarf. Repeat this process, starting with four new 3-foot sour candy strands and weaving in a fifth, to create 2 woven scarf halves equal in length. ",
      "Fray the unwoven section at the top of the scarf halves by pulling the different colors apart. Attach one of the scarf halves to the back of the snowman, securing it with toothpicks.

  "summary": "This is the BEST banana bread I've ever made and tasted. It varies a bit away from the traditional banana bread in it's color (better...golden yellow instead of dark dry), crunchy crust, lack of nuts and fosters glaze, but it is so delicious. I bake my bread at altitude in Denver, CO, so I need to bake it about 15-20 minutes longer at the suggested 350 degrees, but I get a golden brown crunchy crust that is totally worth it. The addition of coconut oil and yogurt keep the consistency of the cake SO moist. The glaze softens the crust and crystallizes it to a yummy chewy, crunchy tooth. I'm in love with this recipe and will continue to make it every time someone wants banana bread.",

Turn off the heat and carefully (in case it flames) stir in the rum and the orange zest.",
